The repository contains all the code required to simulate data for the multilevel explicit-duration hidden Markov model. The simulated data can be found in `simulated_data` folder, and is simulated with `data_simulation.R` script. Moreover, in `Plots` folder, you can find two plots that I included in my research manuscript. The plots in `Plots` folder are generated with `plotting.Rmd` script.

The reproducibility can be further checked with `test.Rmd` file, where results from the simulation study are used for plotting state decoding and saved in `Plots\test.pdf`.
